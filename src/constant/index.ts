export const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Why use ValidationFlow instead of just emailing the client?",
    answer: `💣 1. Because email approvals get lost or ignored.

When you email:
- Clients delay responding.
- You don't know if they actually saw it.
- You forget who said what and when.
- You follow up manually.

✅ ValidationFlow gives you a single decision link.
Send it. Track approval. Follow-up automatically.

🧠 2. Because clients give more honest responses in a private flow.

- No pressure.
- Simple Yes/No or feedback.
- Easy email collection for records.

✅ It’s faster, more transparent, and less awkward.

⏳ 3. Because you want to validate offers — not wait for weeks.

- Don’t chase down feedback.
- Don’t wait in uncertainty.
- Don’t start work without clarity.

✅ ValidationFlow gives you real answers, fast.

🛠 4. Because it's built for freelancers.

✅ Propose.
✅ Track approvals.
✅ Save time.

🔍 5. Because a clean branded link builds trust.

✅ Example:
https://validationflow.com/validation/web-redesign-offer

Clients see:
- A clear proposal.
- A simple way to approve or decline.
- Space for comments or questions.

🎯 ValidationFlow helps you close deals faster and with confidence.`,

    question: "Do clients need an account to validate?",
    answer: "No. Anyone can reply without signing up.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I see who said yes?",
    answer: "Yes. You’ll see names/emails and when they replied.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is it secure?",
    answer: "Yes. Each link uses a unique, unguessable token.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who is this for?",
    answer: "Freelancers, consultants, solo agencies — anyone who wants to validate interest before working.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I view past validations?",
    answer: "Yes. Every response is logged and accessible.",

  {
    question: "Can I delete a link after sharing?",
