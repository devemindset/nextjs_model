    question: "Why use TimeTallyApp instead of Excel or manual tracking?",
    answer: `üí£ 1. Because manual tracking wastes your time.

When you track hours manually:
- You forget to log sessions.
- You lose notes or screenshots.
- You spend 2 hours formatting a PDF for your client.
- You feel overwhelmed every time you need to report your work.

‚úÖ With TimeTallyApp, you just log your sessions and click "Generate Report".
Get a beautiful PDF ready to send ‚Äî in seconds, not hours.

üß† 2. Because ugly reports hurt your credibility.

When your report looks like a spreadsheet from 2005:
- Clients doubt your professionalism.
- You look disorganized, even if you worked hard.
- You spend hours trying to make it ‚Äúlook clean‚Äù.

‚úÖ TimeTallyApp gives you premium, branded reports.
Your work looks polished. Your value is clear. No stress.

‚è≥ 3. Because your time should go into your work ‚Äî not admin.

You don‚Äôt want to:
- Build reports from scratch.
- Chase details at the last minute.
- Waste energy formatting things manually.

‚úÖ TimeTallyApp handles the structure. You focus on your work.

üîó 4. Because you can simply copy a shareable report link.

Want to send your report?
- Copy the link.
- Paste it in an email, Slack, or WhatsApp.
- The client can view it online or download it.

‚úÖ No attachments. No headaches. Just share.

üõ† 5. Because it's made *for* freelancers and remote workers.

- Log your sessions in seconds.
- Track by task or project.
- Generate and share professional PDFs.

‚úÖ Save time.  
‚úÖ Look pro.  
‚úÖ Get paid faster.`,
