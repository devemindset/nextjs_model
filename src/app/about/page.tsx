          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800">Why We Exist</h2>
          <p>
            {'Every day, people waste hours chasing approvals: "Hey, did you see my message?", "Can you confirm?", "Is this okay?" over email, WhatsApp, Slack, and dozens of other platforms. '}
            {'Important decisions are scattered, delayed, or forgotten. Nobody really knows who approved what, when, and how. That‚Äôs where chaos begins.'}
          </p>
          <p>
            {'We built ValidationFlow because we‚Äôve lived that frustration. Whether you‚Äôre a freelancer trying to get client sign-off, a student validating a group project idea, or a creator testing a new campaign, one truth remains: getting a simple "yes" or "no" shouldn‚Äôt be this hard.'}
          </p>
          <p>
            ValidationFlow is here to make validation as fast, clear, and organized as it should be.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8">{"The Problem We're Solving"}</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>Approvals are spread across too many platforms: Conversations happen over email, DMs, Slack threads, and nobody tracks the outcome.</li>
            <li>It‚Äôs unclear who approved what: You lose context or forget who said what ‚Äî and when.</li>
            <li>People forget to respond: You have to follow up manually. It drains your time and patience.</li>
            <li>No accountability: There‚Äôs no audit trail. No proof. No transparency.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            All this creates delays, miscommunication, stress, and poor decisions.
          </p>
